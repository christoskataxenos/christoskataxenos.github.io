Finally, a breath of fresh air. I just submitted the second Written Assignments (GE2) and I feel like I've just stepped out of a time capsule.

To be fair, the **Hellenic Open University (HOU)** has a unique way of keeping us on our toes (or in a state of permanent panic, depending on how you look at it). This time, however, the experience felt like a sci-fi movie... filmed in 1989.

## Pseudocode and Bipolar Disorder

Let's start with the obvious. Someone needs to explain the logic of writing the *exact same* exercise twice. Once in C and once in Pseudocode.

<Callout type="warning" title="Logic Error">
Writing code that works and then having to "break" it to convert it into the university's pseudocode is a form of torture not covered by the Geneva Convention.
</Callout>

The funny thing is you find yourself debugging the pseudocode. "Yes, but is this assignment arrow `<-` correct, or should I have used a colon?". Details that suck the life out of you, while the C compiler just laughs at you.

## ANSI C: Back to the Future

And now for the "main course". It's 2026. Technology is racing, AI is writing poetry, and at HOU we have to write in **ANSI C (C89)**.

Yes, you read that correctly. They ask us to write C as if we're in Back to the Future with Marty McFly. Forget declaring a variable inside a `for loop`. Forbidden. Everything at the top, nice and tidy, just like in '89.

<Terminal title="gcc terminal">
error: 'for' loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 or C11 mode
note: use option -std=c99, -std=gnu99, -std=c11 or -std=gnu11 to compile your code
</Terminal>

Here’s the difference that made our lives difficult:

```c
/* Modern C (How it should be) */
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d", i);
}

/* ANSI C (How HOU wants it) */
int i; /* Must be declared at the top of the block, otherwise error */

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d", i);
}
```

## The Salvation of Python

Fortunately, the second assignment (for the PLH11 module) involved Python. After 48 hours of `malloc`, `structs`, and "segfaults" in ANSI C, writing Python felt like taking off tight shoes after a 10km walk.

Where C required 50 lines of code to read a file, Python did it in 3. The difference in mental health is measurable in coffee cups.

## Conclusion

GE2 was a lesson in patience. I learned how to think like a 1990 computer and how to appreciate modern programming languages. If I survived this, nothing can stop me.

Onward to GE3. With more coffee and fewer `Segmentation Faults` (hopefully).
