There is an unwritten law in Software Engineering: **"If it works, don't touch it"**. At the Hellenic Open University (HOU), however, we discovered a new corollary to this law: **"To make the university's compiler work, you must break everything else that works on your PC."**

Welcome to the Pseudolanguage war.

## The Boss Fight: plh10.exe and Dependency Hell

As part of our studies, we had to use the official compiler/interpreter (`plh10.exe`). At first, we thought it was just an OS issue. "If you have Linux/Mac, forget it," they told us on the forum. But the truth was much darker.

Even on **Windows**, in its "natural" habitat, the tool was... *toxic*. The installation ritual in VSCode was a dangerous one. If you managed (after vows and tampering with the System PATH) to get `plh10.exe` to run Pseudolanguage, suddenly magic happened: **Standard C stopped working.**

<Callout type="danger" title="The Student's Zero-sum Game">
* Want Pseudolanguage? You lose GCC/MinGW.
* Want to write C for the next assignment? You lose Pseudolanguage.
* Want both? **Blue Screen of Death (psychological).**
</Callout>

The VSCode `settings.json` configuration got corrupted faster than a save file in a Cyberpunk game on release day.

## The Equation of Redemption

When patience ($P$) tends to 0 and Environment Pollution ($EP$) tends to infinity, then innovation ($I$) is the only way.

```math
I = \frac{Rage \cdot Coffee}{BrokenConfigs}
```
At that moment, watching my VSCode suffer, I said the historic words: "Fine, I'll do it myself."

Enter: The Web-Based Savior
Instead of fighting conflicts, local paths, and binaries from 1990 that hate modern development, I decided to build something **sandboxed**.

Thus, the **Pseudolanguage Interpreter** was born.


```text
- public
  - index.html
- src
  - core
    - tokenizer.js
    - parser.js
    - executor.js
- package.json
```


No install needed. Doesn't touch the registry. Doesn't destroy your C compiler. You just open the browser and write code. It's Web-based, lightweight, and most importantly **IT IS NOT plh10.exe**.

The Legacy vs The New Way
Since the problem was C, let's see the difference in the language of pain. Look at how my life ran before (Segmentation Fault) and after.

Before the change, the terminal often showed this:


```bash
$ gcc main.c -o main 
Error: 'gcc' is not recognized as an internal or external command. 
PATH is currently pointing to: C:\EAP\PLH10\WHY_ME
```


And here is the logic in code:

```C

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
// #include <sanity.h> // Library not found in HOU

int main() {
    int patience = 100;
    
    // SCENARIO A: The Legacy Workflow
    printf("Attempting to run plh10.exe...\n");
    
    // Simulation of disaster
    if (1) { 
        // Dependency hell strikes
        patience = -2147483648; // Integer Overflow due to stress
        
        // Destruction of GCC environment
        // free(gcc_path); 
        
        printf("Error: Segmentation fault. Your weekend is corrupted.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // SCENARIO B: The Web Solution
    // No system intervention. No malloc.
    printf("Opening Web Interpreter...\n");
    
    // system("start [https://pseudo-interpreter-landing.vercel.app](https://pseudo-interpreter-landing.vercel.app)");
    
    printf("Success: Code running. Dev environment safe.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
The project is live and open for all fellow students who are tired of choosing which programming language to "sacrifice" today to do their assignment.

Because ultimately, the best tool is the one that doesn't need a manual of 50 pages to avoid blowing up your PC.
