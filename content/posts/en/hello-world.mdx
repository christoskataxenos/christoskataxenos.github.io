Every journey in programming begins with the same command. It's not just a print on the screen, it's proof that the system works and awaits our commands.

My name is **Christos Kataxenos**, I am a Computer Science student at **HOU** and this is my dev-log.

Here you won't find theories, but the code I write, the bugs I fix, and the projects I build.

## The Stack

We start from the foundations.

### C
The "mother" of languages. Where you learn what memory management means.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
or 
### Python

```python
def init_journey():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_journey()
```

```
