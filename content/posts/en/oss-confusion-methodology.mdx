There is a myth that tutorial sessions (the so-called OSS - Group Advisory Meetings) exist to clear things up. For 5 weeks now, however, we have been living the exact opposite: **The Methodology Multiverse.**

We started out to learn Pseudocode and ended up losing our sanity, our bearings, and our pointers. But the cherry on top? The grand revelation regarding the final exam.

## The Multiple Solutions Syndrome

The problem isn't that we don't understand. The problem is that we understand **many different things**.

* **Week 1:** "Always perform Top-Down analysis."
* **Week 3:** "You don't need Top-Down here, just keep it simple."
* **Week 5:** "Why didn't you use Top-Down? The exercise gets a zero."

It's like asking 5 different Senior Devs how to center a `div` and getting 5 different answers, but in the end, having to combine them all into one solution that runs on paper.

## The "Plot Twist" of C Language

And here comes the absolute joke of the situation.
For 5 weeks we "bleed" over Pseudocode. We learn to write `Όσο`, `Γράψε`, `Διάβασε` with the reverence of a religious text. We analyze solution methodologies that resemble philosophy.

And suddenly, we realize the bitter truth: **We are not examined in Pseudocode.**

<Callout type="danger" title="The Great Bait-and-Switch">
The exam is in **C**.
Yes, you read that right. We are training in football (Pseudocode) to play the final in Quidditch (C).
</Callout>

All this methodology, the flowcharts, and the Greek commands must suddenly become `printf`, `scanf`, and pointers, without syntax highlighting and without a compiler to save us.

## Coding the Confusion

If I tried to write an algorithm describing our situation, it would be this Frankenstein code (half Pseudocode, half C):

```c
// Program: EAP_Reality_Check
// Purpose: To pass the course without a stroke

#include <confusion.h>

void main() {
    int sanity = 100;
    bool confused = true;

    // Here begins the confusion
    While (sanity > 0) repeat {
        
        printf("Teaching Pseudocode...\n");
        
        if (Exams_Approaching) {
            // Panic Switch
            printf("Surprise! Now write it in C!\n");
            sanity -= 50;
            
            // Syntax Error: Greek inside C logic
            Write("Segmentation Fault in my brain");
        }
        
        sanity--;
    }
}
```

## So, what do we do?

The truth is one: In programming (and especially at HOU), the solution is often a matter of interpretation. I have concluded that the goal is not to solve the problem optimally, but to manage the mental translation from Greek to today's C.

Until then, we continue to write a chimera-code: It thinks like Python, names variables in Greeklish (`timi_temaxiou`), we speak Greek in `printf` (or is it ΤΥΠΩΣΕ, I got confused again) and hope it compiles either in ANSI C, or in the saving **[Web Interpreter](https://christoskataxenos.com/blog/human-vs-compiler)** I built to avoid the asylum.
